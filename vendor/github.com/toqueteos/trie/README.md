# Trie

This is a Go package implementing a trie (prefix tree) over byte slices.

This is a temporary naive implementation that will be replaced with a double-array trie (see
https://github.com/cespare/go-trie). The API will hopefully remain unchanged.

Package documentation may be found on [godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/cespare/trie).
