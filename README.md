# Introduction

With source{d} Lookout, weâ€™re introducing a service for assisted code review, that allows running custom code analyzers on pull requests.

Jump to the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section to start using it!

## Motivation and Scope

source{d} is the company driving the Machine Learning on Code (#MLonCode) movement. Doing Machine Learning on Code consists of applying ML techniques to train models that can cluster, identify and predict useful aspects of source code and software repositories.

source{d} Lookout is the first step towards a full suite of Machine Learning on Code applications for AI-assisted coding, but you can also create your own analyzers without an ML approach.

The benefits of using source{d} lookout are:
- Keep your code base style/patterns consistent,
- Language Agnostic assisted code reviews,
- Identify where to focus your attention on code reviews,
- Automatically warn about common mistakes before human code review.

## Current Status

Currently, source{d} Lookout is in development process.

## Further Reading

This repository contains the code of `lookout` and the project documentation, which you can also see properly rendered at [https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout](https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout).


# Quickstart

_There are different ways to run lookout; we recommend to use `docker-compose` because it's straightforward, but you can [learn more about the **different ways to run lookout**](/docs/how-to-run.md)._

_Please refer to the [**Configuring source{d} lookout** guide](/docs/configuration.md) for documentation about the `config.yml` file._

Using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) you can use the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml) config file to start **lookout**, its dependencies (**bblfsh** and **PostgreSQL**) and a `dummy` analyzer which will add some stats to the watched pull requests.

To do so, clone this repository or download [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Create the `config.yml` file in the same directory where `docker-compose.yml` is (you can use [`config.yml.tpl`](/config.yml.tpl) as a template), and then run:

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
$ GITHUB_USER=<user> GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

If you need to restart the database to a clean state, you can do so with:
```bash
$ docker rm lookout_postgres_1
```
