### Motivation and Scope

source{d} is the company driving the Machine Learning on Code (#MLonCode) movement. Doing Machine Learning on Code consists of applying ML techniques to train models that can cluster, identify and predict useful aspects of source code and software repositories.

**source{d} Lookout** is the first step towards a full suite of Machine Learning on Code applications for AI-assisted coding, but you can also create your own analyzers without an ML approach.

The benefits of using **source{d} Lookout** are:
- Keep your code base style/patterns consistent.
- Language agnostic assisted code reviews.
- Identify where to focus your attention on code reviews.
- Automatically warn about common mistakes before human code review.

### Current Status

Currently, **source{d} Lookout** is in development process.

### Further Reading

This repository contains the code of **source{d} Lookout** and the project documentation, which you can also see properly rendered at [https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout](https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout).


## Quickstart

_There are several ways to run **source{d} Lookout**; we recommend to use `docker-compose` because it's straightforward, but you can [learn more about the **different ways to run source{d} Lookout**](/docs/how-to-run.md)._

_Please refer to the [**Configuring source{d} Lookout** guide](/docs/configuration.md) for documentation about the `config.yml` file, and to know how to configure **source{d} Lookout** to analyze your repositories, or to use your own analyzers._

There is [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml) config file for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) to start **source{d} Lookout**, its dependencies (**bblfsh** and **PostgreSQL**) and a [`dummy` analyzer](analyzers-examples.md#dummy-analyzer) which will add some stats to the watched pull requests.

To do so, clone this repository or download [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml) directly.

Create the `config.yml` file in the same directory where `docker-compose.yml` is. You can use [`config.yml.tpl`](/config.yml.tpl) as a template. Make sure that you specify in the `config.yml` the repositories that will be watched by **source{d} Lookout**. Then run, passing [a valid GitHub user/token](docs/configuration.md#authentication-with-github):

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
$ GITHUB_USER=<user> GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

Once it is running, **source{d} Lookout** will start posting the comments returned by `dummy` analyzer into the pull requests opened at GitHub in the repositories that you configured to be watched.

You can stop it by pressing `ctrl+c`.

If you want to try **source{d} Lookout** with your own analyzer instead of `dummy` one, you must run it in advance, then [set it into `config.yml`](/docs/configuration.md#analyzers) and then run:

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
$ GITHUB_USER=<user> GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> docker-compose up --force-recreate lookout bblfsh postgres
```

If you need to reset the database to a clean state, you should drop the `postgres` container. To do so, stop running **source{d} Lookout** with `ctrl+c` and then execute:

```bash
$ docker rm lookout_postgres_1
```
